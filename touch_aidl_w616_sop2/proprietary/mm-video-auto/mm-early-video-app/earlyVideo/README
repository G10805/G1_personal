                                       EARLY VIDEO APPLICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is a test/reference application for early video demonstration and not for commercialization. Support for this application is limited.
- Application is initialized from common/src/VideoTestApp.cpp
- Input for this application is the hex representation of the video clip, it is pre-computed and stored in utilities/inc/VideoMap.h
- The following assumptions on the video clip have been taken in the application:
        - Width: 1280 Height: 720
        - Width: 1920 Height: 1080
        - Color Format: NV12 8bit
        - H264 encoded video clip
- Currently the application supports video clips with H264 encoding  utilities/inc/VideoH264StreamParser.h and utilities/inc/VideoH264StreamParser.cpp

The following configuration change is required to use the application for 1280x720 resolution video clip:
- argv=1280 in early-init/early_init.conf under [earlyVideo]
The following configuration change is required to use the application for 1920x1080 resolution video clip:
- argv=1920 in early-init/early_init.conf under [earlyVideo]
The following configuration change is required to use the application for default splash.h264 1280x720 resolution video clip:
- argv=default in early-init/early_init.conf under [earlyVideo]

The following changes are required to re-use the application with another video clip:
- Array in utilities/inc/VideoMap.h
- utilities/inc/VideoH264StreamParser.h and utilities/inc/VideoH264StreamParser.cpp needs to be changed for other encodings
- utilities/inc/VideoPlatform.h and common/src/VideoTestApp.cpp needs to be changed for other encodings
- NUM_FRMS_PARSE macro has to be updated accordingly

Optimization Technique implemented:
- Optimization has been done on BuildOffsetTable call.
- BuildOffsetTable function earlier uses readBuffer function which uses read_file() calls to read the video, byte by byte from an input video clip and builds the offset table, read_file() call is a costly operation in terms of time taken.
- Instead of reading the video file every time to access a byte, using an array to represent the video file (hex dump of the video file) and reading the bytes directly from this array would optimize the function.

- In this application, the above mentioned optimization technique has been implemented. The array used by this method is pre-computed and stored in utilities/inc/VideoMap.h
