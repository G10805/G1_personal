# Application
Sample applications to demonstrate FastCV usage.

## Sample app info:
* simple-test:
    - Demonstrates a simple usecase with FastCV for various operation modes.
    - It downscale a grayscale image pattern and perform corner detection using Harris corner detection algorithm.
* nsp-simple-test:
    - Demonstrates a basic pipelining usecase with FastCV NSP library.
    - It reads a raw UYVY image and converts to RGB888 and downscale.
