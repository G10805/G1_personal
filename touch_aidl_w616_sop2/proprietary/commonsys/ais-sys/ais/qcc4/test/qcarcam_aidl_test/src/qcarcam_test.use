QCarCam AIDL test application.

Test application that reads a configuration XML for the camera and windowing properties.
It sets up the display windows using the native OS APIs through test_util library.
It sets up the cameras using the QCarCam API.

======
Usage:
======
qcarcam_aidl_test [-config=FILE] [-dumpFrame=FREQ] [-startStop=FREQ | -pauseResume=FREQ] \
	[-noDisplay] [-singlethread] [-printfps=TIME] [-checkbuf=ENABLE] [-showStats=ENABLE] \
	[-c2d=ENABLE] [-cache] [-csc=ENABLE] [-di=MODE] [-nomenu|-nonInteractive] \
	[-fatalErrorRecover] [-checkdualcsi] [-retry] [-seconds=TIME] [-gpioNumber=GPIO] \
	[-gpioMode=MODE] [-allocator=ALLOCATOR]


-config=FILE
	XML configuration file to be used.
	Default if argument unspecified is qcarcam_config.xml

-dumpFrame=FREQ
	Dumps frames to a file when frameID % FREQ == 0

-startStop=FREQ | -pauseResume=FREQ
	{Stops and starts | [pauses and resumes} the streams when frameID % FREQ == 0

-noDisplay
	offscreen streaming. Does not post buffers to display.
	Default is onscreen

-singlethread
	Uses single thread to setup and start all streams.
	Default is multithreaded where each stream is setup using its own thread.

-printfps=TIME
	Prints FPS and state report of all streams every TIME seconds

-checkbuf=ENABLE
	Enables checking of buffer states and printing them as part of the FPS report.
	Default is disabled

-showStats=ENABLE
	Prints performance stats related to API operations
	Default is disabled

-c2d=ENABLE
	Creates extra set of offscreen buffers and coverts using C2D prior to posting to display foramt
	Default is disabled

-cache
	Uses cached buffers. Only valid for offscreen operation (i.e. noDiaply)
	Default is disabled

-csc=ENABLE
	Creates extra set of offscreen buffers and converts using CSC library prior to posting to display foramt
	Default is disabled

-di=MODE
	Enable De-Interlacing mode for interlaced content
	Default is disabled

-nomenu|-nonInteractive
	Does not setup or show menu.
	NOTE: Specify this if launching the test app in background

-fatalErrorRecover
	Enable test app to try and recovery stream in cases of fatal errors.
	Stops and starts the stream again.
	Default is enabled

-checkdualcsi
	Enables Dual CSI pattern checker where the left half of the image must match the right half.
	Default is disabled

-retry
	Retries a few times if the ais_server is still in process of detecting streams.

-seconds=TIME
	Exit app after TIME seconds

-gpioNumber=GPIO
	Specify GPIO to be used as toggle
	Default is disabled

-gpioMode=MODE
	Specify action of GPIO toggled
	Default is disabled

-allocator=ALLOCATOR
	Specify buffer allocator.
	For QNX, this can be used to select between pmem v1 or v2 handle used for QCarCam buffers

========
Examples
========
	o Launch with xml config file (default it expects is qcarcam_config.xml)
		"qcarcam_test"

	o to specify config file
		"qcarcam_test -config=test_config.xml"

	o to pause/resume or stop/start after "x" frames:
		"qcarcam_test -pauseResume=100"
		"qcarcam_test -startStop=100"

	o to dump frame after "x" frames:
		"qcarcam_test -dumpFrame=100"

	o to launch in background without menu:
		"qcarcam_test -nomenu &"

FPS Report Example
==================
​
--------FPS Report - 10.0 sec-----------
| id | qid |  state (time)| fps  | rel  |
|  0 |  0  | ok      (9.2)| 28.5 | 28.3 |
|  1 |  0  | ok      (9.2)| 28.5 | 28.3 |
|  2 |  0  | ok      (9.2)| 28.5 | 28.3 |

id
	Specifies Stream id - index into xml
​
qid
	Specifies qcarcam stream id

​state (time)
	OK - Stream receiving frames and is OK. time will be printed if transition occured
		since the last report. Time will be since first frame after transition.
	START - Stream was started but have not received first frame yet. Time since start command returned.
	STOP - Stream is Stopped
	PAUSE - Stream is Paused
	ERROR - Stream got an error event and is in error state
	FREEZE - Stream did not get new frames for >1 second. Time will be since the last frame we received.

fps
	Rate of frames recieved from QCarCam
​
Rel
	Rate of frames released to QCarCam
